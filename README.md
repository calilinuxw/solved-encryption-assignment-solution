<strong>1)     </strong>(15 pts) The following is a ciphertext<strong>:</strong>

a)     U GIRJ CFJ SWAY. SWAY UR JQW GUCB-TUDDWY. SWAY UR JQW DUJJDW-BWAJQ JQAJ LYUCPR JFJAD FLDUJWYAJUFC. U NUDD SAKW GM SWAY. U NUDD EWYGUJ UJ JF EARR FOWY GW ACB JQYFIPQ GW.

b)     What kind of cipher text is this? Mono- or Poly alphabetic; Hint: assume one and when that does not work look for the other

c)     Describe your cryptanalysis process. Show all the steps you went through to decrypt the message. The steps should be in sufficient details so that a reader would be able to decrypt the encrypted text <u>without needing any help from you</u>.

d)     If you did find solution somehow please show steps as if you are trying to find the solution. So I know you have exercised your knowledge

e)     State the plain text message.

f)      List features of the cipher- text that hindered and helped your decryption process. mention of helpful and hindering features
